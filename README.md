# Ccodes
My sample C++ and Python codes using OpenCV for learning

**To compile and run a C++ program**

1. To compile a C prorgam, use the following make command.

```
NAME=<Name of the project folder> make

For example:

NAME=Canny_edge_detector make
```

2. This will generate a ".a" executable file inside the project folder. Run the program using the following command.

```
For example:
cd Canny_edge_detector
./Canny_edge_detector.a
```
